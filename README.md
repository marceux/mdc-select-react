# mdc-select-react

Simply put: it's a React implementation of the [Material Components for Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) [Select Component](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/packages/mdc-select)

## To-Do

- Figure out a way to pass `onChange`, `onFocus`, and `onBlur` callback function props to the component.
- Abstract the Menu component to its own class
- Wire up the Menu component foundation to the class
